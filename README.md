1.Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis: Empowering Decision-Making through Dynamic Insights

Problem Statement: Advanced Dashboard Development for Loan Data Analysis. The current approach to loan data analysis lacks depth and interactivity, hindering the ability to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting methods fall short in providing a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a pressing need for advanced dashboard design to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of our loan data.

Objective: Our objective is to craft a suite of interconnected dashboards that deliver dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from robust data analysis. These dashboards are meticulously designed to offer a holistic perspective on our lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating strategic decision-making based on data-driven insights.

Dashboard 1: Executive Summary
Purpose: This dashboard provides an overview of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating the overall efficiency and performance of our lending endeavors.

Key Features:

Total Loan Applications: Monitor total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, scrutinizing Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable insights.
Total Funded Amount: Evaluate the cumulative disbursed funds and track MTD disbursements, analyzing MoM variations to discern funding patterns.
Total Amount Received: Assess cash inflows via total and MTD received amounts from borrowers, scrutinizing MoM fluctuations for financial health assessment.
Average Interest Rate: Determine the cost of lending by computing and tracking the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM changes.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrowers' financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans and monitoring MTD and MoM changes.

Loan Performance Analysis:

Classify loans into "Good" and "Bad" categories based on specific KPIs such as application percentages, funded amounts, and received amounts.
Implement a "Loan Status Grid View" for detailed categorization by loan status, providing insights into various metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

Dashboard 2: Trends & Overview
Purpose: This dashboard offers interactive visualizations to illuminate lending trends, borrower demographics, and loan purposes, facilitating pattern recognition and opportunity identification.


Key Visualizations:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Explore seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Highlight significant lending regions and analyze geographical disparities.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understand the distribution of loans across different terms.
Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Assess the impact of employment history on lending metrics.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Visualize the reasons behind borrowers' financing needs.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Examine the influence of home ownership on loan applications and disbursements.


Dashboard 3: Detailed Insights
Purpose: This dashboard offers a deep dive into loan data, equipping users with comprehensive access to key metrics and loan details, empowering informed decision-making.
Objective: The "Details Dashboard" serves as a user-friendly platform providing a comprehensive solution for in-depth analysis of the loan portfolio, augmenting our capacity to make informed lending decisions.


Implementation Strategy:

Craft each dashboard with an intuitive layout to ensure seamless navigation and interaction.
Integrate real-time data for up-to-the-minute analysis and decision-making.
Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to continually refine and enhance dashboard functionalities.

By fulfilling these objectives, we aim to optimize our lending strategies, bolster financial health, and elevate borrower satisfaction through insightful data analysis and strategic dashboard design.




You're analyzing bank loan data across states, months, loan grades, status, and ownership to uncover patterns in loan approvals, funding, and repayments.

Note: DTI- Debt to income ratio, MTD: Month to Date, MoM: Month over Month
Low DTI (e.g. < 20%) → Safer borrower → Higher chance of "Good Loan"
High DTI (e.g. > 40%) → Risky borrower → Higher chance of "Bad Loan"

- MTD tracks cumulative metrics from the start of the current month up to today.
- MoM compares a metric of the current month to the previous month.
Note: CSV Data is already in table view of file. You have no need to keep other files like csv data files explicitly as they r already loaded into pbix file.
